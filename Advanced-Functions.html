It takes 2 values as parameters, 1st is the function()(we need to write and define the function then and there itself) we want to delay and 2nd is the number of "MILISECONDS" by which we want the function to delay

      }, 3000); //js just sets up the timer and goes to the next line of code, it won't wait for that line to finish. THIS IS CALLED ASYNCHRONOUS CODE
      // Synchronous code on the other hand will wait for one line to finish before going to the other line of code
      //all the code we generally write is synchronous, code is asynchronous only when written using certain functions of Javascript
      //Advantage of asynchronous code is that it doesn't block our code for 3 seconds, it just sets the timer and moves on to the next line

INTERVAL WILL BE PRINTED IN THE CONSOLE EVERY 5 SECONDS. computer will set a timer and move to the next line and execute it
